# Privacy Policy for List2Buy

_Last updated: June 10, 2025_

List2Buy ("the app") is a modern, offline-first React Native application for creating and managing gift lists and shopping lists. This privacy policy explains how List2Buy handles your data and your privacy rights.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

- **Offline-First:** All list data (gift lists, shopping lists, settings) is stored locally on your device. No list or personal data is sent to any server or cloud service by the app.
- **No Account Required:** You do not need to create an account or provide personal information to use the app.
- **No Cloud Sync:** The app does not sync your data to any external server or cloud provider.

## 2. Data Sharing

- **Export/Import:** You may choose to export or import your lists. Exported files are encrypted and shared via your device's share options. The app does not transmit your data to any third party.
- **Sharing Lists:** When you share a list, the app creates an encrypted file that you can send using your device's sharing options. The app does not access or transmit this data except as directed by you.

## 3. Analytics

- **No Analytics:** The app does not collect analytics or usage data. No information about your usage is sent to any analytics provider.

## 4. Advertising

- **AdMob Integration:** The app uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect device information and use cookies or similar technologies to serve and personalize ads. See [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information.
- **Consent:** On first launch, the app will ask for your consent to show personalized ads. You can choose to allow or deny personalized ads. If you deny, only non-personalized ads will be shown.
- **Ad Frequency:** Ads are shown at a limited frequency (e.g., saving a list) and never interrupt critical app functionality.
- **No Data Sharing:** The app does not share your list or personal data with AdMob or any other third party.

## 5. Permissions

- **Storage:** The app requests access to your device's storage to save and load your lists.
- **Network:** The app uses network access only for loading ads (if enabled) and for sharing lists if you choose to do so.

## 6. Security

- **No Remote Storage:** Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export or share it.
- **File Encryption:** Exported and shared files are encrypted to protect your data during transfer and storage.

## 7. User Rights

- **Data Deletion:** You can delete your lists at any time from within the app. Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data.
- **Consent Management:** You can change your ad consent preferences at any time in the app settings.

## 8. Children’s Privacy

List2Buy does not knowingly collect or solicit any personal information from children under the age of 13. The app does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. All data remains on the user’s device. If a child uses the app, all data is local and can be deleted by removing lists or uninstalling the app. As the developer, I do not have access to any user data and cannot delete information on your behalf.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in this file.

## 10. Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your data, please contact the developer via the app store listing or the app's GitHub repository.
